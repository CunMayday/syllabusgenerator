## POLICIES

Students who wish to review current policies (academic appeals, attendance/tardiness, etc.) should refer to the Policy Information in the current Purdue University Global’s Catalog.

Purdue University Global's Artificial Intelligence (AI) Policy and Resources can be found on

the PG Center for Teaching and Learning's website. Students are encouraged to review the

posted policy and refer to course materials for detailed guidance on AI use within each
individual course.

As a student, you work hard to earn your degree. Protect the integrity of your work. Do not
share your assignments, papers, quizzes, tests, etc. with other students. Do not directly or
indirectly share your work by posting it to a third party website. Do not make use of another
student’s work in any academic activity. Unless specifically instructed to work in groups, do not
collaborate with your classmates on assignments or tests. These actions violate the Purdue
University Global Code of Student Conduct policy and, as a result, carry consequences. In
some cases, students who are found in violation of these policies are dismissed from the


University. You can also review the Writing with Integrity document located in Academic Tools in
your course.

If you have questions about these policies, please review these policies in the catalog and

 contact your instructor.

**ACADEMIC ACCOMMODATIONS** - If there are any academic accommodations you feel would be
helpful to you in your classes, please do not hesitate to reach out to Student Accessibility Services
(SAS) for assistance.

_NOTE: The contact information below is to request academic accommodations only and should not be used to contact your instructor. You can contact your instructor through the Brightspace
classroom._

 Tel: 317- 208 - 1686

 Fax:866- 422 - 4773 (Toll Free)

TTY: TTY users may dial 711 from their TTY phone, at no charge, to be connected with a

Telecommunications Relay Services (TRS) operator who will assist with the call.

Accommodations cannot be granted retroactively and you are required to submit supporting

documentation needed to process the request.


## LATE POLICY

You are expected to submit all assignments and projects by the end of the unit.

Students may turn in late work up to two weeks after the assignment due date. After that time,
a zero will be assigned for each assignment. Ten percent of the assignment value will be
deducted after the assignment is graded for each week that an assignment is late. For example,
suppose your assignment worth 100 points is due on Tuesday and you submit it on Wednesday.
In that case, 10 points will be deducted after it is graded. If you submit it two weeks late, there


will be a reduction of 20% from the original assignment value after the assignment is graded.

All late work must be submitted by Sunday of the last unit. No late work will be accepted after this without an Incomplete Grade approval.

Certain course activities may not be eligible for late submission. These include, but are not limited to discussions, seminars, quizzes, labs, exams, and clinical activities.

Extenuating circumstances can interfere with timely submission of your work. Be sure to
communicate with your professor and your Student Advisor immediately if you will be late with a submission.

Your professor will determine whether an exception to the Purdue Global Late Policy is
appropriate. Your professor may also require you to provide documentation of the reason.
Suppose your professor determines that an extension is warranted. In that case, your professor will provide you with the expectations for your submission or assignment in writing.

Extenuating circumstances include, but are not limited to, personal/family member
hospitalization, family member death, a severe weather event, a natural disaster, and an active military assignment that prevents internet connectivity. Computer-related issues, Internet connectivity, and account blocks are generally not considered extenuating circumstances.

(APA style).

### Honor Code – Graduate School of Business and Information Technology

Before completing and submitting assignments, all students should be familiar with and
adhere to the honor code.

## SEMINARS

Seminars provide you with an opportunity to converse with your instructor and peers, and to

resolve questions about the course. Your instructor will provide specific guidelines to save you
valuable time and effort and support your course success. You must either attend the live

Seminar or complete the alternative assignment to earn points. Seminar Rubrics are located in

 the Grading Rubrics section of Course Resources.

Seminar topics and pre-work, if applicable, can be found in Course Resources.

**Option 1- Attend Seminar:**

Throughout your program, you will be asked to attend various Seminars. Seminars take place at
designated times in specific units. Your instructor will give details about the Seminar during the

first week of the course. Please review your Course Announcements and emails.

Suppose you are unable to attend the Seminar. In that case, you must review the archived
recording and complete the alternative assignment by the unit's end.


**Option 2- Alternative Assignment: Reflective Assignment**

While listening to this week’s archived Seminar, complete a reflective document. You may write

the assignment in a bulleted list format OR paragraph format. APA style is not required.

Please include:

- The main topics discussed
- Sub-topics and/or subsequent classroom discussion
- Points you found of interest
- Any additional reflections or suggestions.

## DISCUSSION BOARDS

### A description of all discussion topics can be found under each of the units in the course.

### Discussion Participation :

Each week, students must post messages to their colleagues and the instructor responding to
discussion topics and research field trips. Discussion Board participation will be graded based
on both level of activity and quality of interaction. Your active and thoughtful participation will

 weigh heaviest in the determination of your participation grade.

- Post a minimum of three posts per discussion topic - one initial response and two replies
    to your classmates.
- Posting on a minimum of three different days, for example, Wednesday, Friday, and
    Monday.
- Provide an initial post that responds to the discussion topic question(s) by Saturday at
    11:59 p.m. ET.

Theory into practice discussions, distinguished video and discussions, and web field trip discussions will be evaluated using the Discussion Board Grading Rubric.

## RUBRICS


A rubric is a tool used by your instructor to determine your performance on assessments
(assignments, discussions, Seminars, etc.) throughout your course. The rubric lists the criteria
for the assessment on which you will be graded. You should follow the rubric, so you
understand what is expected of you in each assignment. Following the rubric will help ensure you do not lose points unnecessarily on any graded item.

**Assignments** : Rubrics for all assignments and projects can be found in the unit in which the assignment is presented.

**Seminars** : Each response will be graded individually and posted to the Gradebook using the

### Grading Rubrics found under Course Resources.

**Discussion Boards:** A discussion grade will be posted to the Gradebook for each unit.
Discussion board rubrics are available within the unit in which the discussion board is presented.

## NETIQUETTE

Interactions in an online classroom can be in written form as well as in audio or video. Your
comfort level with expressing ideas and feelings in writing will add to your success in an online

course. The ability to write is necessary, but you also need to understand what is considered
appropriate when communicating online.

The word "netiquette" is short for "Internet etiquette." Rules of netiquette have grown organically
with the growth of the Internet to help users act responsibly when they access or transmit

information online. As a student, you should be aware of the common rules of netiquette for the web and employ a communication style that follows these guidelines.

- Wait to respond to a message that upsets you and be careful of what you say and how
    you say it.
- Be considerate. Rude or threatening language, inflammatory assertions (often referred
    to as "flaming"), personal attacks, and other inappropriate communication will not be
    tolerated.
- Never post a message that is in all capital letters — it comes across to the reader as
    SHOUTING! Use boldface and italics sparingly, as they can denote sarcasm.
- Keep messages short and to the point.


- Always practice good grammar, punctuation, and composition. This shows that you have
    taken the time to craft your response and that you respect your classmates' work.
- Keep in mind that Discussion Boards are meant to be constructive exchanges, and it is
    important to respect those views that are different from yours.
- Be respectful and treat everyone as you would want to be treated yourself.
- Use spell check before sending a written message

Using a webcam in an online meeting room requires thought and consideration for the

netiquette environment. Keep your surroundings free of clutter and distraction. Do not allow
others in your setting to enter the webcam view. Be sure your attire and background are

appropriate for a classroom setting. If in doubt, turn off your camera. When using a microphone

be mindful of your mute button - stay on mute until it is an appropriate time to speak - then
enable your mute button again when you have finished sharing. Also, be mindful of how you

reply to differing opinions or course content that you may not agree with. Feel free to express
your views and ask questions in a calm and respectful way.

You should also review and refer to the section on Responsible Use of University
Technology contained in the most recent Purdue Global Catalog.
