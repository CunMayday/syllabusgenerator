**Third-Party Tool / Lab Naming Conventions for Gradebook:**

* Titles for all assignments/activities in third-party tools must match Brightspace Gradebook names and naming conventions, including spacing, capitalization, etc.  
* ***Do not use the following special characters*** when naming both graded and ungraded activities in the third party tool since this interferes with Gradebook syncing: \\ / : \* ? “ \< \> | ‘ , ; ( ) \[ \] .  
* Acceptable names: Unit X Lab Assignment, Unit X Lab Quiz, Unit X Lab Reading Chapter 3, Unit X Lab Learning Activity  
* Every activity/item in the third party tool with points assigned needs a corresponding item in the Brightspace gradebook, even if the points do not count toward the 1000 point total. This includes **Kaltura Quizzes.** (If the Brightspace gradebook is missing any of these items, when students complete these activities, an item will be added to the gradebook automatically and interfere with the 1000 point total.)

**Philosophical Foundations and the Three Methodological Pillars** 

This first unit is the most important step in the DBA journey, marking your transition from a seasoned business executive to a rigorous scholar-practitioner. It requires moving beyond practical experience to understanding the philosophical worldview that dictates all research design. We won't just look at what tools to use, but why those tools are appropriate based on your view of reality. We'll dive into the core concepts of ontology (the nature of reality, e.g., Is there a single truth, or are there multiple subjective truths?) and epistemology (the nature of knowledge, e.g., How can we know what is real?). Your answers to these foundational questions establish your methodological paradigm, which is the non-negotiable starting point for your doctoral study.

Your philosophical stance directly dictates your selection of the three major methodological pillars: Quantitative, Qualitative, or Mixed Methods. This unit provides the critical language to differentiate these approaches. Quantitative research typically operates deductively, seeking generalizable, measurable relationships and causal laws. Qualitative research, conversely, often operates inductively, seeking deep, contextual understanding and rich meaning within specific organizational settings. The choice isn't arbitrary; it must be a precise alignment between your research question (e.g., Are you testing an existing model or exploring a new phenomenon?) and the methodological tools best suited to yield a reliable answer.

Ultimately, the goal of this module is to give you the confidence and scholarly rigor to defend your methodological choice within your DBA research proposal. Mastery of this unit ensures that you not only understand the characteristics of each approach but also possess the analytical framework to justify why a specific paradigm is the only valid way to investigate your complex business challenge. By the end of the unit, you'll have established the essential intellectual blueprint for your study, ensuring its coherence, alignment, and contribution to both academic theory and professional practice.

**Discussion Overview**

**Topic:** Justifying Your Methodological Stance 

**Part 1: Initial Post (Due Saturday)**  
The fundamental difference between doctoral-level research and business analysis lies in the **philosophical and methodological justification** of the approach. As a scholar-practitioner, your first critical task is to align your research problem with an appropriate research paradigm.  
**Consider your preliminary DBA research interest** (the complex, real-world business challenge you might want to study).  
   
1\. 	**Identify and Articulate Your Stance:** Which of the three major methodologies—**Quantitative, Qualitative, or Mixed Methods**—do you believe is the *most appropriate* approach for investigating your research problem?  
2\. 	**Justify the Choice (The "Why"):** Explain the core reason(s) for selecting this methodology.  
o   What specific **epistemological** (how we know) or **ontological** (what is reality) assumption does your choice reflect? (e.g., Are you seeking a single, measurable truth (Post-Positivism), or a contextual, shared meaning (Interpretivism/Constructivism)?)  
o   Why are the *other two* methodologies less suitable for your research question? For example, if you chose Qualitative, explain why a purely Quantitative or Mixed Methods approach would fail to capture the necessary data or answer your specific "why" or "how" question.  
3\. 	**Provide an Example:** Briefly identify one commonly used **research design type** associated with your chosen methodology that you might use (e.g., Survey, Case Study, Grounded Theory, Explanatory Sequential).  
*(Your initial post should be approximately 250-350 words.)*

**Part 2: Peer Responses (Due Tuesday)**  
Respond to at least **two** colleagues' initial posts.  
1\. 	**Challenge the Assumption:** For one colleague who chose a methodology different from yours, suggest a specific, doctoral-level research question that would be *better suited* to one of the **other two** methodologies (Quantitative, Qualitative, or Mixed Methods). Briefly explain the change in perspective required.  
2\. 	**Reinforce the Alignment:** For another colleague, provide an example of a specific type of **business phenomenon** or **research objective** (e.g., investigating *causal relationships*, exploring *lived experiences*, seeking *generalizability*, or *integrating different perspectives*) that perfectly exemplifies the **epistemological alignment** they described in their post. This should demonstrate a clear understanding of the philosophical foundation of their chosen method.

**Assignment Details**

Methodological Justification Memo 

**Deliverable:** A **Methodological Justification Memo** (approx. 750-1000 words).  
   
Based on your preliminary DBA research interest (i.e., your potential research problem), draft a memo that accomplishes the following:  
 

1. **Describe and Differentiate** the three major methodologies (**Quantitative, Qualitative, Mixed Methods**), explaining their fundamental differences in terms of epistemology (how knowledge is gained) and typical application in business research.   
     
2. **Identify and Describe** the one major methodology (Quantitative, Qualitative, or Mixed Methods) that is most appropriate for your current research interest. Justify your choice by explicitly stating the nature of the problem you are addressing and the type of answer (e.g., generalizable causal relationship, in-depth contextual understanding, or multi-faceted perspective) you need to achieve.   
     
3. **Propose a Preliminary Research Design Type** (e.g., Case Study, Survey, Experimental, Explanatory Sequential) *within* your chosen methodology and briefly explain why it is the best fit for your problem. 

**Formatting Requirements:**  
 

* APA 7th edition formatting for citations and references.  
* Clearly structured with headings and subheadings.  
* Word count: 750-1,000 words (excluding title page and references).

**The Literature Review as Methodological Foundation**

The literature review, often viewed simply as a summary of past research, holds a far more profound and methodological significance at the doctoral level, particularly within an Applied DBA program. This unit shifts your perspective from passively consuming knowledge to actively leveraging the body of scholarly work as the intellectual foundation for your own contribution. A rigorous literature review doesn't just catalog what is known; it acts as a critical synthesis tool that justifies the existence of a research gap and establishes the theoretical need for your proposed study. Ultimately, the quality and defense of this review determine whether your research is deemed relevant, original, and academically sound, moving your work beyond mere organizational consulting to impactful, evidence-based scholarship.

The necessity of this unit is underscored by the direct relationship between the literature review's content and the methodological decisions explored in Unit 1\. The way you organize and critique existing literature must explicitly align with your chosen research paradigm—Quantitative, Qualitative, or Mixed Methods. For a Quantitative study, the review must systematically define variables, establish conceptual frameworks, and build the logical case for testable hypotheses. Conversely, a Qualitative review focuses on framing the phenomenon, identifying the limits of current, often quantitative, understanding, and justifying an inquiry that allows for emergent, in-depth understanding. The review is thus a structural blueprint, demonstrating that your methodological choices are theoretically grounded and necessitated by the current conversation in your field.

Consequently, this module will equip you with the advanced skills required to transition from research consumer to producer. You will master the systematic steps of a doctoral-level literature review, from rigorous search strategies and source evaluation to sophisticated thematic synthesis. The focus will be on critical appraisal, specifically learning how to evaluate the rigor of existing studies to defend their inclusion (or exclusion) and how to strategically structure your own argument. By the end of this unit, you will possess the ability to use the literature review as a powerful defensive tool that justifies your research problem, validates your methodology, and sets the definitive stage for your DBA research proposal.

**Topic: The Literature Review as the Methodological Justification**

The DBA literature review is not merely a course requirement; it is the primary tool used to establish a research gap and defend the rigor of a proposed doctoral study.

1. Defense of Purpose: In your own words, explain and defend the core reasons a DBA-level literature review must be an extensive, critical synthesis rather than a simple summary of current knowledge. Why is this comprehensive defense *essential* for a practitioner-scholar seeking to create actionable knowledge?  
     
2. Evaluating Rigor: Describe the process you would use to evaluate a source for inclusion in your final proposal. Specifically, differentiate between how you would assess the rigor (quality and trustworthiness) of an empirical quantitative article versus an empirical qualitative article. For example, what key sections (beyond the abstract) do you prioritize, and what are the "red flags" that might lead you to exclude a study as non-rigorous?  
3. Your initial post should be approximately 250–350 words in length.

**Assignment Details**

**Method-Aligned Literature Review Outline** 

This assignment requires you to apply the steps of the literature review process  and demonstrate how the final structure must align with a specific methodology.

1. **Choose a Methodology:** Select either the **Quantitative, Qualitative, or Mixed Methods** approach for your current or potential DBA research topic.  
     
2. **Conduct a Preliminary Search:**  
   1. **Search Steps:** Briefly list the 4-5 steps you undertook to find the literature (e.g., initial keywords, specific databases used, inclusion/exclusion criteria for date/relevance).  
   2. **Annotated Bibliography:** Provide an annotated bibliography of **five (5) seminal or highly relevant sources** that are foundational to your topic. The annotation should not summarize the source but critically explain *how* it contributes to the body of knowledge and why it is essential for your study.  
        
3. **Develop a Method-Aligned Outline:** Create a **detailed, topic-based outline** (using Roman numerals and alphabetical sub-points, e.g., I. Theoretical Foundation, A. Construct A, 1\. Variable Y) for the literature review section of your DBA proposal. **The structure of this outline must explicitly reflect and justify your chosen methodology:**  
   1. **Quantitative Outline:** Must prioritize defining key variables, presenting models, and logically leading to hypotheses.  
   2. **Qualitative Outline:** Must prioritize establishing the phenomenon's context, the limits of current understanding, and the theoretical/conceptual framework that will guide the inquiry.  
   3. **Mixed Methods Outline:** Must clearly show how the literature for the quantitative component is structurally separated from or integrated with the literature for the qualitative component, justifying the need for the combined approach.

**Formatting Requirements:**  
 

* APA 7th edition formatting for citations and references.  
* Clearly structured with headings and subheadings.  
* Your assignment should be approximately 750-1,000 words in length (excluding title page and references).

**Theory Development and the Research Framework** 

In applied business research, theory is the crucial mechanism that elevates a practical organizational inquiry into a rigorous doctoral study. This unit focuses on mastering the advanced application of theory, which moves the DBA candidate beyond observing a business problem to offering generalizable, evidence-based solutions grounded in scholarly tradition. Theory provides the necessary "why" and "how"—explaining the causal connections between business phenomena and providing a systematic framework for investigation. You will learn the systematic steps required to locate, critically evaluate, and successfully integrate established theories, ensuring your proposed research is a genuine intellectual contribution that builds upon and extends the existing body of knowledge, which is a core requirement for a defendable doctoral proposal.

A central element of this module is distinguishing between the deductive and inductive uses of theory, a differentiation that hinges entirely on your chosen methodology. For quantitative research, theory operates deductively as the non-negotiable start point; it dictates the variables, defines the hypothesized causal relationships, and provides the logical structure for the entire study. Conversely, in most qualitative research, theory is often used inductively, either as a theoretical lens to frame the inquiry or as the end point—the new theoretical understanding that emerges directly from the data. Understanding this distinction is vital, as the inappropriate application or placement of theory is a common flaw in early doctoral designs.

Consequently, this unit provides the intellectual tools to formalize the theoretical foundation of your research proposal. You will practice modeling the relationships between variables, defining their measurement with scholarly precision, and understanding the theoretical arguments that justify your design. By the end of this module, you will not only be able to identify the most relevant theories for your complex business challenge but will also be able to articulate and defend your approach to theory usage, transforming abstract concepts into a concrete theoretical framework that is structurally sound and aligned with your methodological choice.

**Discussion Overview**

**Topic: Inductive vs. Deductive Theory Application**

The choice between using theory **deductively** (as a start point) or **inductively** (as an end point or guiding lens) fundamentally distinguishes Quantitative from most Qualitative research.

1. **Differentiating Theory Use (CLA 2):** Explain the major distinctions between the **inductive** and **deductive** uses of theory. Provide a brief example of a DBA research question best suited for each approach (e.g., testing a specific organizational behavior model vs. exploring a new leadership phenomenon).  
     
2. **Qualitative Applications (CLA 4):** Building on your explanation, distinguish between using a theory as a **theoretical standpoint** (e.g., stakeholder theory to frame the research) versus allowing theory to be an **end point** (theory emerging from data, like in Grounded Theory). Why must a qualitative researcher be cautious about applying a deductive approach too early in the research process?  
3. Your initial post should be approximately 250–350 words in length.

**The Doctoral Research Proposal: Structure, Style, and Ethics**

Unit 4 marks the critical transition from theoretical design choices to the formal construction of the DBA research proposal. This document is far more than a plan; it is the scholarly contract that validates the rigor, relevance, and feasibility of your doctoral work. Building upon the methodological and theoretical foundations established in the preceding units, this module details the nine key topics that must be included in a high-quality proposal. Mastery of this architecture is non-negotiable, requiring the ability to structure and present your problem statement, literature review, and methodology in a clear, persuasive narrative that convinces peers and reviewers of your study's merit and originality.

A crucial element of proposal mastery lies in understanding how the structure must flexibly adapt to align with the philosophical and practical demands of the chosen methodology. You will learn to compare the structural differences between Quantitative, Qualitative, and Mixed Methods proposals, particularly within the methodology chapter. For instance, a Quantitative proposal must strictly follow a deductive path, detailing sampling formulas and instrumentation, whereas a Qualitative proposal must emphasize the role of the researcher, the establishment of trustworthiness, and the site selection justification. This methodological alignment ensures the coherence of the study, demanding that the structure itself becomes a powerful tool of justification and defense.

Finally, as a scholar-practitioner focused on impactful, real-world solutions (PC 6.3), the research proposal must be underpinned by a comprehensive commitment to ethical standards. This unit integrates ethical foresight into the design process, requiring you to identify potential issues—from informed consent challenges to conflicts of interest—and proactively develop mitigation strategies at every stage of the research lifecycle. Furthermore, crafting this document demands a refined doctoral writing style, marked by conciseness, coherence, and scholarly precision, ensuring that the sophistication of your design is matched by the clarity and professionalism of your written argument

**Topic Ethical Dilemmas in Applied Research**

.Doctoral research, especially applied research within an organization, is inherently complex and carries significant ethical responsibilities.

1. **Identify and Strategize:** Based on your current or hypothetical DBA research topic, identify **two significant ethical issues** that could arise **before** conducting the study (e.g., in the proposal/IRB stage) and **one significant ethical issue** that could arise **during or after** data collection (e.g., during analysis or dissemination).  
     
2. **Mitigation Plan:** For each of the three issues identified, describe a specific, rigorous strategy you would include in your proposal's **Ethics Section** to address or mitigate the potential harm or challenge. For example, if a pre-study issue is 'Coercion of Subordinates,' what specific language or process would you include in the Consent Form and IRB submission to prevent it?  
3. Your initial post should be approximately 250–350 words in length.

**The Proposal Introduction: Assessing Rigor and Structure** 

The Introduction section is the first and arguably most critical component of the DBA research proposal, serving as the ultimate test of the study's methodological rigor and scholarly contribution. This unit is dedicated to mastering the precise, systematic construction of this chapter. It is here that you establish your command of the field by demonstrating that your proposed research is not merely addressing an organizational challenge, but is filling a significant, demonstrable scholarly gap within established theory. If the Introduction fails to convincingly make this case, the entire design's validity and practical contribution are immediately called into question.

Central to this module is understanding the four essential components that form the structural backbone of a high-quality doctoral introduction. These components must follow a strict logical sequence, beginning with the broad organizational problem and funneling down to the specific contribution and purpose of your study. Furthermore, you must assess how the Introduction's rhetoric and emphasis must flexibly adapt to align with your chosen methodology. A quantitative introduction builds a deductive case for measuring variables and testing hypotheses, while a qualitative introduction builds an inductive case for exploring a rich phenomenon and understanding contextual meanings, thereby demonstrating how the structure itself reinforces the core philosophical paradigm. 

By mastering these architectural and rhetorical requirements, you elevate your professional communication skills and ensure the successful launch of your research proposal. This unit ensures that every sentence in your opening chapter works persuasively to justify the complex methodology that follows, ultimately transforming a general organizational interest into a focused, defendable, and methodologically sound doctoral research project.

**Introduction to the Methodologically Aligned Purpose Statement** 

The purpose statement is the single most definitive sentence in a DBA research proposal, serving as the ultimate declaration of the study's intent and providing the crucial first assessment of its methodological rigor. This unit is dedicated to mastering the precise construction of this statement, which must seamlessly connect the broad organizational **problem** (Unit 5\) to the specific **research questions** (Unit 7\) in a defensible logical chain. A flawed purpose statement—one that is vague or methodologically misaligned—signals a fundamental flaw in the research design and can undermine the entire proposal.

Mastering the purpose statement requires understanding the unique formulas dictated by the three major methodologies. For quantitative research, the statement must clearly articulate the intent to test, compare, or relate specific variables within a defined population. For qualitative research, the statement must clearly express the intent to explore or understand a single, central phenomenon and its context, utilizing three mandatory components. Finally, the mixed methods statement requires the integration of four components, including a clear rationale for why combining data is necessary to fully address the problem.

By the end of this unit, you will have moved beyond general statements of intent to crafting sentences of scholarly precision. This rigor in language is essential for professional communication, ensuring that the study's aim is immediately clear, defensible, and perfectly aligned with the philosophical and theoretical commitments made in earlier units. This skill is paramount, as a methodologically sound purpose statement is the necessary foundation for generating appropriate, answerable doctoral research questions.

**Discussion Overview**

**Topic: The Intentional Focus: Problem Flow and Central Phenomenon**

The coherence of a research proposal relies on the seamless flow from the problem to the purpose to the questions.  
	

1. **Assessing Coherence:** Describe a complex organizational problem relevant to your DBA field. Then, describe how that broad problem must be narrowed to become a feasible research purpose that a single doctoral study can address. Explain why failing to narrow the problem effectively breaks the entire research design flow.  
     
2. **Evaluating Focus:** Using your identified organizational problem, draft a Qualitative Purpose Statement (a single sentence) intended to address it. From this statement, identify the Central Phenomenon. Defend the methodological rigor of this choice: Why is isolating this phenomenon (using specific qualitative components) critical for ensuring the study doesn't accidentally slip into a quasi-quantitative or purely descriptive approach?  
     
3.  Your initial post should be approximately 250–350 words in length.

**Mastering the Purpose Statement Formulas**

**CMS: This would be added to the Gold sidebar callout**

**The following Course Outcome is assessed in this assignment:** 

**GB730-2:** Assess the methodological rigor of existing research to support the design's validity, reliability, and practical contribution of a proposed research study.

This assignment requires you to appy the precise formulas for purpose statements across the three methodologies.

**Part I: Methodological Synthesis** 

Using a single, relevant DBA topic for coherence, craft the following three methodologically  
distinct purpose statements:

1. **Quantitative Purpose Statement and Analysis**   
   1. **Statement:** State a quantitative purpose statement that includes variables and their hypothesized relationships.  
   2. **Component Analysis:** Explicitly list and identify the Independent Variable(s), the Dependent Variable(s), and the Target Population within your statement.

   

2. **Qualitative Purpose Statement and Component Analysis**   
   1. **Statement:** State the purpose to explore/understand (e.g., for the same topic, explore the perceptions of the quantitative findings).  
   2. **Component Analysis:** Explicitly list the three major components required for this type of statement (Action Verb, Phenomenon, Participants/Site).  
3. **Mixed Methods Purpose Statement and Component Analysis**   
   1. **Statement:** State the purpose to integrate data (e.g., Explanatory Sequential Design).  
   2. Component Analysis: Explicitly list the four essential components required for this type of statement (Quant Aim, Qual Aim, Design Type, Rationale for Integration).

**Part II: Assessing Rigor** 

Find and critically evaluate the Purpose Statement from a published doctoral study (DBA or  
PhD dissertation in a business field) that uses a Quantitative methodology.

1. **Present the Found Purpose Statement:** Quote the purpose statement exactly as it  
   appears in the study.  
2. **Methodological Rigor Assessment**  
   1. **Evaluate its soundness:** Assess whether the statement is methodologically sound based on the rules learned (i.e., does it clearly identify the intent, variables, and population?).  
   2. **Assess its contribution:** Evaluate if the statement clearly supports the study’s practical contribution. Does the way the purpose is articulated suggest a useful, actionable outcome for business practice? Why or why not? What makes the study rigorous enough to support the trustworthiness of the research findings?

**Formatting Requirements:**  
 

* APA 7th edition formatting for citations and references.  
* Clearly structured with headings and subheadings.  
* Word count: 750–1,000 words (excluding title page and references).

**Introduction to Crafting Methodologically Sound Research Questions and Hypotheses**

Unit 7 is where the DBA proposal reaches its highest level of methodological precision, translating the study’s generalized purpose into the specific, actionable questions and hypotheses that govern the research plan. These statements are the final check on your design’s rigor: they must align perfectly with your theoretical framework, your purpose statement, and, most importantly, the type of data collection instrument you intend to use. If a question is poorly formulated, the resulting data collected will be insufficient or irrelevant, jeopardizing the study’s contribution and feasibility.

Mastery of this unit involves recognizing that the structure and language of these questions are dictated entirely by the methodological paradigm. For quantitative studies, questions are transformed into precise, testable hypotheses (null, alternative, directional) that dictate the necessary statistical tools and survey designs. For qualitative studies, the approach is inverted: the researcher develops broad, open-ended central questions and focused sub-questions that utilize process-oriented language to guide interview protocols and observational strategies, allowing theory to emerge from the data.

Furthermore, in this module, you will learn to craft integrated mixed methods questions that explicitly articulate the *mixing* of quantitative and qualitative data sets, which is essential for rigorous design. By practicing the application of these methodological rules, you ensure that your research instruments—the focus of the next unit—are perfectly calibrated to accurately capture the intended research objectives, resulting in a seamless and highly defensible DBA research design.

The language used in crafting questions and hypotheses fundamentally determines the type of data and instrument needed.

1. **Quantitative Types:** Based on your DBA topic (e.g., the relationship between leadership style and profitability), draft a set of one null hypothesis and one alternative directional hypothesis. Explain the difference between these two types and why a researcher typically includes both.  
     
2. **Qualitative Structure:** Draft a qualitative central question and at least three qualitative sub-questions for a study exploring a related, non-quantitative aspect of your topic (e.g., employee perceptions of leadership). Defend the use of open-ended, non-directional language in these questions, explaining why directional hypotheses would be methodologically inappropriate for a typical qualitative design.

1. **Quantitative Foundation:** State one fully written quantitative research question (not a hypothesis) that aims to describe or compare an aspect of your topic. Then, briefly identify the type of data collection instrument (e.g., survey, archival database, standardized test) that would be methodologically sound for collecting the data required to answer that specific question.  
     
2. **Mixed Methods Integration:** Based on the same topic, draft a complete set of mixed methods questions for an explanatory sequential design (QUANT QUAL). This set must include:  
   1. One quantitative question (Ques )  
   2. One qualitative question (Ques )  
   3. One mixed methods question (Ques ) describing the intent and procedures for linking the two data sets (e.g., "How do the qualitative findings regarding manager motivation help explain the statistical results of the relationship between training and retention?").

**Planning Quantitative Research Designs: Surveys and Experimnts** 

Unit 8 initiates the deep dive into the practical construction of the DBA proposal's methodology chapter, specifically focusing on the most common quantitative designs. This unit is pivotal because it requires you to translate your theoretical variables and testable hypotheses into a concrete, rigorous plan for data collection. You will learn that a sound quantitative methods section is a structural argument, organized into four primary elements, that systematically proves your chosen approach is the most effective and feasible way to generate numerical data needed to address your research questions.

The core of this unit lies in clearly differentiating the planning requirements for two major quantitative approaches: surveys and experiments. A survey research method plan (often used to establish correlation or description) must rigorously detail the sampling frame, instrument validity/reliability, and data collection procedures. Conversely, an experimental research method plan (used to establish causation) must detail entirely different elements, such as control, manipulation, random assignment, and internal/external validity threats. Understanding these distinctions is crucial, as the wrong design decision or missing elements will invalidate the study's conclusions.

By the end of this unit, you will not only be able to identify the essential elements of quantitative planning but will also be able to apply this knowledge to design a methodologically sound study. This skill ensures that your plan for data collection (whether via a survey or an experiment) is perfectly aligned with your hypotheses and maintains the necessary scientific rigor to defend your findings and contribute meaningful, generalizable knowledge to the field of applied business administration.

**Creating a Defensible Quantitative Method Blueprint**

**CMS: This would be added to the Gold sidebar callout**

**The following Course Outcome is assessed in this assignment:** 

**GB730-3:** Plan methodologically sound instruments for data collection that accurately capture research objectives.

This assignment requires you to create a cohesive, integrated blueprint for the methodology chapter (quantitative section) of a DBA research proposal. Your goal is to design a study that is rigorous, logically integrated, and capable of addressing a complex business challenge.

**Part I: The Quantitative Research Design Blueprint**   
Choose one contemporary business topic relevant to your DBA concentration (e.g., leadership, organizational change, finance) and design a complete quantitative research study by detailing the following five interconnected sections:

1. **Framing the Study:**  
   1. **Research Question:** State a clear, measurable quantitative research question (e.g., *To what extent does X predict Y...*).  
   2. **Hypothesis:** State the corresponding null and alternative hypotheses.  
2. **Design Selection & Justification:**  
   1. **Chosen Design:** Select and justify either a survey/cross-sectional design or a Quasi-Experimental Design.  
   2. **Rigor Justification:** Explain why the chosen design is the most appropriate way to achieve internal validity (or control for threats) for your specific research question.  
3. **Sampling Plan:**  
   1. **Sampling Technique:** Select and justify a specific probability sampling iechnique (e.g., stratified random sampling).  
   2. **Practicality:** Explain how this technique will be practically executed within your target organizational setting to maximize external validity (generalizability).  
4. **Instrument Plan:**  
   1. **Instrument Type:** Identify the specific type of quantitative instrument (e.g., established Likert scale, archival data set, physiological measure).  
   2. **Rigor Check:** Describe two specific, standard procedures you will use to assess and confirm the reliability (e.g., Cronbach's alpha) and validity (e.g., construct validity) of this instrument for your study.  
5. **Data Analysis Plan:**  
   1. **Statistical Test:** Identify the specific statistical test you would use to address the hypothesis (e.g., multiple regression, ANOVA, $t$-test).  
   2. **Rationale:** Justify *why* this test is appropriate based on the number of variables and the level of measurement (nominal, ordinal, interval/ratio) of your data.

**Part II: The Mixed Methods Bridge** 

While your primary focus is quantitative, **c**reate a follow-up, post-quantitative qualitative research question (e.g., an explanatory question) and use it to create a mixed methods purpose statement that links the quantitative and qualitative aims.

1. **Mixed Methods Purpose Statement:** State the purpose, including the four required components (quant aim, qual aim, sesign type,rationale for integration). This acts as a conceptual bridge to future units.

**Formatting Requirements:**  
 

* APA 7th edition formatting for citations and references.  
* Clearly structured with headings and subheadings.  
* Word count: 750–1,000 words (excluding title page and references).

**Planning Qualitative Research Designs: Data, Analysis, and Trustworthiness**

Unit 9 provides the deep dive into the qualitative methodology chapter, focusing on the rigorous planning required for studies that seek depth, context, and meaning rather than statistical generalizability. For the DBA candidate, this module is essential for translating exploratory research questions into a concrete plan for gathering rich data. You will learn that a sound qualitative design is not a free-form exploration, but a systematic argument that begins with selecting the appropriate design (descriptive or analytic) and then detailing a defendable strategy for accessing the participants and phenomena central to your study.

The core application in this unit centers on instrument planning and the essential steps of analysis. You will master the construction of the interview protocol and contrast the methodological advantages of using various data sources, such as interviews versus organizational documents. Equally critical is the planning of the seven systematic steps of data analysis. These steps, from coding to thematic development, ensure that raw data is transformed into rigorous, defensible findings that support the emergence of new theory from organizational context, moving beyond mere anecdotal evidence.

Finally, this unit emphasizes the unique challenge of establishing trustworthiness and rigor in the qualitative paradigm, which is paramount for doctoral-level work. You will detail specific, practical approaches—such as member checking or triangulation—and learn to articulate these choices in your proposal. This knowledge, coupled with the proper writing strategies for reporting qualitative results, ensures that your methodology is not only sound but is communicated with the professional clarity necessary to contribute impactful, contextually rich knowledge to applied business science.

**Designing Integrated Mixed Methods Research** 

Unit 10 is the capstone technical design unit, demanding the creation of a complete, high-quality applied research study using the sophisticated mixed methods approach. In the complex, multi-layered world of applied business, a single quantitative or qualitative lens is often insufficient to fully capture the problem; mixed methods designs offer the rigor of generalizability alongside the depth of contextual understanding. This final technical unit teaches you to design the structure that bridges these two powerful paradigms, moving your role from method critic to chief research architect, ready to finalize your proposal.

The foundation of a mixed methods proposal is the justification. You will learn how to build an airtight case for integration, arguing that the combination of numerical testing and textual exploration yields a superior, more robust finding (the metainference) that neither method could achieve alone. This requires precise knowledge of the core designs—such as explanatory sequential or convergent parallel—and the ability to choose the correct design based on the priority and sequence required to solve the specific business challenge. This decision dictates the entire execution plan and is crucial for the proposal's defense.

Ultimately, mastering this unit means mastering integration, which is the point where the different data sets are explicitly linked. You will detail the intent, procedures, integration, and validity of a core mixed design and plan methodologically sound instruments for both components. By the end of this unit, you will possess the specialized knowledge to design a complex, integrated study, having synthesized all the knowledge from the course to prepare the final, defendable DBA research proposal.

**Discussion Overview**

**Topic: Justifying Mixed Methods and Data Contrast** 

Mixed methods designs require rigorous justification and clarity regarding the data being used (**PC 3.2**).

1. **Justification:** Create a justification paragraph for why a mixed methods approach is necessary to address a complex business challenge related to your DBA topic (e.g., the success of digital transformation). The justification must explain why a single quantitative *and* a single qualitative study would each be insufficient to fully solve the problem.  
     
2. **Data Contrast:** Contrast how the final quantitative data (e.g., a coefficient table or statistical visualization) will be presented in the final report versus how the final qualitative data (e.g., thematic analysis or in-depth participant quotes) will be presented. How do these distinct presentations contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the topic than either one alone?  
     
3. Your initial post should be approximately 250–350 words in length.
